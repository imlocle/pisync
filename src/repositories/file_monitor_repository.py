"""
File monitoring repository for detecting and processing media file changes.

This module uses watchdog to monitor a directory for new media files and
automatically transfers them to a Raspberry Pi. It includes file stability
checking to prevent race conditions where files are transferred before
they're fully written to disk.

Classification is based purely on folder structure:
- Files in Movies/ directory are treated as movies
- Files in TV_shows/ directory are treated as TV shows
